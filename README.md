About the model:

In this repository, we implement YOLOv4 for training on your own dataset.

We will take the following steps to implement YOLOv4 on our custom data:

  - Configure our GPU environment 
  - Install the Darknet YOLOv4 training environment
  - Download our custom dataset for YOLOv4 and set up directories
  - Configure a custom YOLOv4 training config file for Darknet
  - Train our custom YOLOv4 object detector
  - Reload YOLOv4 trained weights and make inference on test images

When you are done you will have a custom detector that you can use.
